# As you can notice the data above isn't linearly separable. Since that we should add features (or use non-linear model). Note that decision line between two classes have form of circle, since that we can add quadratic features to make the problem linearly separable. The idea under this displayed on image below:

# ## Training
# In this section we'll use the functions you wrote to train our classifier using stochastic gradient descent.
# 
# You can try change hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate and so on to find the best one, but use our hyperparameters when fill answers.

# ## Mini-batch SGD
# 
# Stochastic gradient descent just takes a random batch of $m$ samples on each iteration, calculates a gradient of the loss on it and makes a step:
# $$ w_t = w_{t-1} - \eta \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \nabla_w l(x_{i_j}, y_{i_j}, w_t) $$
